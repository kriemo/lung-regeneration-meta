  - Generated marker tables and figures comparing the transitional and aberrant basaloid populations
  - Built a UCSC cellbrowser for the scvi and scanvi integrations, hosted on aws S3 @  http://lung-meta-2023-zemans.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. 
  - Ran monocle3 as an additional pseuodotime algorithm to show.

  - Performed pseudotime with slingshot on harmony, scanVI, and scVI projections.

  - Fixed heatmaps, was using an outdated singlecellexperiment object.

  - Made heatmaps of key genes from figure 7 for scANVI and scVI projections.

  - changed color palette to loupe-like colors
  - changed the coloring of the UMAP plots to plot in order of expression
  - looked into scVI AT1 cells, which are a mix of different clusters in each study,
    showing a discrepancy between the UMAP and clustering results.
